## General Information
- This project involves analyzing a dataset containing daily bike rental counts in a city.
- The background of the project is to provide insights into the factors affecting bike demand and to build a predictive model.
- The business problem being addressed is to help bike-sharing companies optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction by predicting bike demand.
- The dataset used in this project is the "day.csv" file, which contains daily records of bike rentals along with various attributes such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.


## Conclusions
- The temperature is positively correlated with bike demand, indicating higher rentals on warmer days.
- Humidity and windspeed have a negative correlation with bike demand, suggesting lower rentals on more humid and windy days.
- Seasonal trends show that bike rentals peak in the fall and are lowest in winter.
- The predictive model built using linear regression provides a good fit for the data, with significant predictors including temperature, season, and weather conditions.
